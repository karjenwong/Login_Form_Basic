# Login_Form_Basic

This file was a result of an exercise to create a login form. 

Filled Form filled out will be validated by jQuery and basic Javascript. 

Ajax will post data to itself(index.php). 

PhP code will run to validate username/password or return a default error message. 

Styling is written directly in the html and through jQuery DOM manipulation depending on user inputs.
